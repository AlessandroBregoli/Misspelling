Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them 
 So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes 
  The first little pig was very lazy 
 He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw 
 The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks 
 Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day 
  The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks 
 It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney 
 It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds 
  The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside 
 He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water 
  So he knocked on the door and said:      
  "Little pig! Little pig!     
  Let me in! Let me in!"
